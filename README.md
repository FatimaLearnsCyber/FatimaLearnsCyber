# Fatima Muhammad

Computer Science student focused on Security Operations, Blue team work, detection engineering, and defensive automation.

My work centers on building hands-on lab environments to simulate security events, analyze endpoint behavior, investigate logs, and develop scripting tools that support incident response and monitoring workflows. I am particularly interested in SOC operations, network security, incident response, digital forensics and cloud security.
